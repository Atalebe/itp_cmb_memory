Public release of the ITP CMB Memory Kernel analysis.  Includes data, scripts, and reproducible pipelines used in: “A Direct Reconstruction of the Primordial Universe from CMB Phase Correlations: Evidence for a Cosmological Memory Kernel” — Stephen Atalebe (2025).  
# ITP CMB Memory Kernel — Public Release

This repository contains the complete public release of data, code, and figures for the paper:

**Stephen Atalebe (2025)**  
*A Direct Reconstruction of the Primordial Universe from CMB Phase Correlations: Evidence for a Cosmological Memory Kernel.*

## ✨ Overview

This project performs the **first direct reconstruction of a cosmological memory kernel** from CMB phase correlations. Using Planck PR4 data and a non-Markovian inverse framework (ITP), we show:

- Highly significant detection: **p < 10⁻⁴**  
- Kernel induces **contractive backward dynamics**  
- **Blind injection–recovery** shows pipeline fidelity  
- Full reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum

All data and scripts here are sufficient to reproduce every figure and core scientific result.
